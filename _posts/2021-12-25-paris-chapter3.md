It's been a month since a post, and I've got a lot to catch up on in this blog. With out further ado, here's a list of what we've been up to. 

## Le Centre Pompidou

Shortly after the last blogpost, Angela and I checked out the [Centre Pompidou](https://www.centrepompidou.fr/en/) museum. It's a fun modern art museum that was having an exhibit on Georgia O'Keeffe. It was cool to see the Frenchies experience her - she's not very well known here, but the people their seemed to like her. We also ate at [Georges](https://restaurantgeorgesparis.com/en/), the restaurant on top of the museum - good food, great views.

## Thanksgiving

A few days later, we had an American Thanksgiving! We had two teachers over that Angela works with, plus a partner and a cousin in tow. It went down surprisingly well! We got a turkey (from an American food specialty store), and made green beans, potatoes, and Angela's mushroom gravy. Antoine (the cousin) made a pumpkin pie - and whipped cream too! It was super fun - the "first Thanksgiving" for one of Angela's co-workers.

## Archives Nationales

Angela and I live on "Rue des Archives", named after the Paris branch of the [National Archive](https://www.archives-nationales.culture.gouv.fr/en_GB/web/guest/site-de-paris), which is set up in some old prince's estate. It was pretty cool, lots of old documents on display, some over 1000 years old.

There were English translations of some French exhibit descriptions - this one was the funniest "Franglish".

## Strasbourg, Capital of Christmas

Just few days ago, we took the train to Strasbourg for a day (and then to Frankfurt for two). Stasbourg has "the biggest Christmas market in the world", and ills itself as the "Capital of Christmas". It was fun - very old school French/German city center, very pretty. We wondered around town most of the day.

There was an old covered bridge we went through used to store old gargoyles and statues.

The crowds got a little crazy in the evening.

There was plenty of treats and "Vin Chaud" to be had.

At the end of the day we went to Brasserie Les Haras, [they talk about it in this NYT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4oRS-72INY&ab_channel=TheNewYorkTimes) - which is Michelin rated but not too expensive.

## The Frank Ford on the Main

Then we went to Frankfurt! We went to a botanical garden ...

## Merry Christmas!

Merry Christmas from Paris everyone! Looking forward to seeing you all in the new year! We're keeping warm and doing crafts. On Christmas eve we went to a Paris Christmas market - much smaller but I kind of liked it better than Strasbourg. We had roasted chestnuts for the first time (would recommend).
