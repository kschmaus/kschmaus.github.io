## These Boots Were Made For Walking

We left our moldy apartment on Thursday, the 11th of November, and ever since then Paris has been SO much more enjoyable! 

After the weekend we kept getting the run around from our Airbnb host - no firm dates on when anything would be resolved, no extra door key, no access to the mailbox. Finally, we decided that no resolution was likely to come. Thankfully, Airbnb was very understanding, and allowed us to cancel without a penalty, and partially reimbursed us for our stay. So long to terrible apartments.

## I'll Be There For You

Ever since I moved into the mold apartment, each day I scoured the internet for alternative listings (other Airbnbs, hotels, furnished rentals, ...). Paris is a pretty hot market, and it was really hard to find something else that worked for us, but eventually I found a nice loft in the 4th arrondissement, in [le Marais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marais). It's much bigger, pretty posh, and best of all, has no mold. It has a very "90s boho loft" aesthetic. This is our new spot until the end of April, and we're both super happy about it.

Tall ceilings, a large living room, reasonably sized kitchens and bathrooms (reasonable for Paris), plenty of storage - it feels pretty luxe right about now. We did pick up a couple cheap items from Ikea, like a coat rack and some bins for recycling. Maybe the best thing about the new place has been the landlord. Instead of a shady company, she's a single person with one Airbnb listing. She's super communicative and kind, and has already sent us a second pair of keys, a new water kettle, ordered us a dining table and a set of chairs,  and scheduled repairs on the dishwasher and freezer.

The neighborhood is super cute, too. A lot of tile "graffiti" (very touristy but I'm here for it). A lot of cute restaurants and grocery options - we both really liked eating at the "Queen Anne". We're also just a few blocks from [Le Centre Pompidou](https://www.centrepompidou.fr/en/) (we're planning on going today, actually!).

The downsides of the new sport are it's more expensive, and Angela's commute is quite a bit longer now (she works in the 9th and 10th). I lucked out - there's another WeWork that's a 3 minute walk away - "WeWork CÅ“ur Marais".

## Americans Just Want to Have Fun

On Saturday the 13th we met up with a mixed group of French and Americans, and did Karaoke until 2:00am. It was a blast! Unfortunately, I don't think we took any photos, that night - our bad. We met them in front of a Lego store, so there's this pic of Angela.

It was fun to paint the town red - I hadn't stayed out that late in a long time! A small selection of our songs

* Kyle's Songs: Holding out for a Hero, Zombie, Heaven is a Place on Earth
* Angela's Songs: Tiny Dancer, Bad Romance, Skyfall 

## Board Game "Fun"

Ever since the pandemic, Angela and I have both been obsessed with [www.boardgamearena.com](www.boardgamearena.com). It's been a great way to socialize during pandemic times - and now that we're over seas it's a good way to "hang out" with people in the US (shameless plug, reach out to us if you want to schedule some time to game with us). 

We've both been playing a lot of Agricola - a fairly complicated farming game. Angela realized you could play it in solitaire mode, and ever since then we've been trying to min-max the the highest possible score (we are a fun couple :D). So far this is our best effort:

## Other things

* I got a haircut in Paris.

* We had Angela's teacher friend over, and we're planning on having a few of her coworkers over for a "Thanksgiving" this Saturday.
