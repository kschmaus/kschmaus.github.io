## Best Laid Plans

I took Thursday October 28th off of work. In the morning I worked with a personal organizer to pack all our kitchen items into boxes. In the evening I packed my suitcases with clothes, and other essentials to get by in France for 6 months. That day went according to plan. 

I took Friday October 29th off of work as well. In the morning I had movers come by and transport all my boxes and furniture to a storage unit. In the evening I had dinner with my friends Patrick and Hilary, and went to bed early, checking in at the Marriott in SOMA. That day went according to plan.

On October 30th I emptied my apartment of the leftover odds and ends, packing off some into my storage unit and the rest into my luggage. I put my bike in a friends basement (thanks again Hilary!). In the afternoon I had a late lunch with my brother Alex and their partner Jessica. So far, everything according to plan! 

In preparation for my trip, I'd been setting my morning alarm earlier and earlier. Every day I woke up 20 or 30 minutes earlier than the day before. On October 31st, the day I flew, I woke up at 3:30AM. That morning things did not go according to plan. 

I woke up to a message from our Airbnb host that they had double booked themselves. Angela was meant to checkin that day, but now they wouldn't be ready for us until November 4th. Over the next hour I was messaging the host, talking to Airbnb support on the phone, and relaying things to Angela. The host offered us another listing, but it was on the other side of town, on the 6th floor with no elevator - there was just no way Angela could get all her luggage their by herself. Eventually we settled on Angela getting a hotel in the area we'd be staying. This wasn't the last issue with the host though, not by a long shot. 

## Reunited And It Feels So Good 

Thankfully, the rest of my travel day was uneventful. I showed up at the airport plenty early. I can't recommend enough getting TSA pre-check - it's kind of BS but you end up getting "lordly" treatment compared to everyone else. I skipped the line, and had to do far less security theater. The flight itself was under-booked, and I was able to move to a row where I got 4 middle seats all to myself. I slept after dinner, actually being able to lay down in my personal row.

Angela and I met at the airport. I hadn't seen her in over a month, so it was pretty great. We hopped on a bus to head into Paris and our Hotel (in the 9th arrondisment). On the 2nd and 3rd we didn't do much. I worked on those days, and when I wasn't working we went out to eat. We were in a small hotel room with 2 big suitcases apiece, and other bags besides, so we were never really able to unpack. We just didn't have the space. I was still adjusting to the timezone as well. We did eat very well though - it's not hard in Paris. My favorite spot was _"Le Petit Canard"_, where I had the onion soup and the cassoulet; both were delicious and rich.

## And Now Listen To My Tale Of Woe

During this time I was messaging our hosts: they still hadn't given us checkin information. At the end of the 3rd, nothing. I took the 4th off of work, expecting it to be a long day (I wasn't wrong). In the morning I called them multiple times, and on the other line heard (_en fran√ßais_) that their message machine was full. Finally, after 12:00 when we'd checked out of our hotel room, Angela got ahold of them. They said they'd send us an email with a link describing the checkin process, and then hung up. A link did come, but it was broken ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

We got them back on the phone - "Can you send a picture of the information". They did, but their picture didn't say anything about what the gate code was, or how to get the key. After a third call, we finally got all the information. When we showed up at 3:00pm, the specified time, we were met by a representative of the host. He was nice enough and apologetic, even a little charming (he really needed to be), but he explained that they wouldn't be done cleaning the apartment until 4:00pm. Ok. We grabbed some food at a caf√©, and came back an hour later. Finally we checked into our place. 

It wasn't perfect. There was only one key to the door (we were told they would get us a second key "soon"). The bed-frame was damaged somehow, and creaked profusely with any movement from either of us. By far the worst issue, however, was the mold. When we checked in, the apartment still smelled of cleaning product, but as that wore off, I realized there was something that smelled seriously musty. I first noticed a little bit of mold in the laundry room, and then more and more in the kitchen area.

The smell is not overwhelming, but it is somewhere between mildly and moderately unpleasant. I decided that it was "safe" to say here a few nights, but not a good idea for us to stay here for 6 months. Exhausted and angry, I wrote a letter to the host and to Airbnb support explaining the situation. Given the last few days, my hopes of them dealing with situation weren't very high. Thankfully, I woke up to the following message: 

![](/assets/images/2021-11-07-paris-chapter1/message.jpeg)

Great I thought, maybe we can make this work. I was told that an agent would come to the house tomorrow (Saturday) to "take care of it". "Fantastic, _merci beaucoup!_ Is there a time I should expect them?" Radio silence for much of the day, then a message that "the agent hasn't confirmed the time". Ok. I worked the rest of the day at an Airbnb (which was quite nice), having a lunch of apples and p√¢t√© at the park.

We never got a time when the agent would be there on Saturday (the 6th). We stayed at home till around noon, but after that we had things to do. So we left a note on the door with Angela's French cell, and went out running errands (mostly a trip to Ikea and a prospective trip taking a look at dehumidifiers). We never got a call - from the host or any contractor. 

Today (Sunday the 7th) we took a trip to check out _"La REcyclerie"_, an old train station that's been turned into a large caf√© that does gardening and repair workshops, amongst other things. I was hoping that there'd be some kind of composting program we could sign up to, but no such luck. Then we went and saw the (new) Dune movie - which I'd highly recommend (that could be its own post üòÇ). But back to the main drama, Airbnb and I are giving the host until the end of Monday to make **some** measurable progress on resolving the issue. We'll see what happens. Paris is a hell of a rental market, especially for short-term furnished units. Airbnb has said they'd help us out if we can't end up staying here, but I'm not sure what that would ultimately entail. I've looked at where else is available online - it's pretty slim pickings. There are a few places that might work, almost all of them are further from the schools Angela is teaching at, more expensive, or both. We can afford more expensive, but it wasn't the plan. We'll see what happens tomorrow.

It hasn't been all doom and gloom. It **has** been stressful to be sure, but Paris is beautiful and exciting. Getting around is easy, and the city is packed with things to do. The food is great, at both restaurants and at cute organic grocers and specialty shops. I have a huge list of museums, galleries, game shops, and karaoke bars we'll be hitting up. And it's been great to be back together. Soon we'll put this this initial turbulence behind us. Until then, wish us luck.
